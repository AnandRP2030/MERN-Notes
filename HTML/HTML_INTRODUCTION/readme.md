## WEB INTRODUCTION

    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fundamental technologies used in web development to create and enhance the structure , style  and functionality of web pages.

## Different types of web application

    1. Static Applications:

    Definition: Static applications deliver fixed content to all users, and the content remains the same until it's manually updated.

    Example: A basic HTML website without any interactive features. Each visitor sees the same content, and any changes require modifying the HTML files directly. Blogs or brochure-style websites that rarely change content are often static.

    2. Dynamic Applications:

    Definition: Dynamic applications generate content on-the-fly based on user input, preferences, or real-time data. The content can change without manual intervention.
    Example: Social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter are dynamic. Your news feed is generated based on your interactions and the activities of people you follow. Online shopping websites dynamically display product recommendations based on your browsing history or preferences.

 ### Summary
    static applications provide fixed content that doesn't change without manual updates, while dynamic applications generate content dynamically, often in real-time, based on user interactions or other data

## HTML

    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

    1. Purpose: HTML is used for creating the structure and content of web pages. (table, navbar, footer etc)
    2. Syntax: It consists of a series of tags that define different elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.

    <!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

## CSS

    1. Purpose: CSS is used for styling and layout, allowing developers to control the appearance of HTML elements on a web page.

    2. Syntax: It uses selectors to target HTML elements and declarations to define styles such as colors, fonts, margins, padding, and more.

    body {

    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    }

## JavaScript:

    Purpose: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to manipulate the content and respond to user actions.
