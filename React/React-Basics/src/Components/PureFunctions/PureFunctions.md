`async` and `await` are keywords in JavaScript that are used to work with asynchronous code. Asynchronous code allows you to perform tasks without blocking the execution of the rest of your code. This is particularly important in scenarios where operations, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file, may take some time, and you don't want to freeze the entire program while waiting for these operations to complete.

Here's a brief explanation of `async` and `await` with examples:

### `async` Function:

The `async` keyword is used to define a function as asynchronous. An asynchronous function always returns a promise.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  return "Data fetched!";
}

// Call the async function
fetchData().then((response) => {
  console.log(response); // Output: Data fetched!
});
```

### `await` Operator:

The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function. It is used to wait for a Promise to resolve before moving on to the next line of code.

```javascript
function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, ms);
  });
}

async function exampleAsyncFunction() {
  console.log("Start");

  // Wait for the delay function to complete
  await delay(2000);

  console.log("After delay");
}

// Call the async function
exampleAsyncFunction();
```

In this example, `exampleAsyncFunction` prints "Start," then waits for 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) using the `delay` function before printing "After delay."

### Why use `async/await`:

1. **Readability:**

   - Async/await makes asynchronous code more readable and easier to follow compared to using callbacks or promises.

2. **Error Handling:**

   - With `async/await`, error handling is more straightforward and resembles synchronous try-catch blocks, making it easier to manage errors in asynchronous code.

3. **Sequential Code:**

   - `async/await` allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, making it easier to understand and reason about.

4. **Avoiding Callback Hell:**

   - Async/await helps to avoid the "callback hell" problem that can occur when nesting multiple callbacks.

5. **Concise and Maintainable:**
   - It leads to more concise and maintainable code, especially for complex asynchronous operations.

Here's an example that demonstrates using `async/await` with the `fetch` API to make an asynchronous HTTP request:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}

// Call the async function
fetchData();
```

In this example, `fetchData` is an asynchronous function that makes an HTTP request using `fetch`. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the asynchronous operations to complete, and error handling is done using a try-catch block.
