1. What is React?
   React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.

The important features of React are:

1. It supports server-side rendering.
2. It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
3. It follows unidirectional data binding or data flow.
4. It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.
5. Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency: React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.
