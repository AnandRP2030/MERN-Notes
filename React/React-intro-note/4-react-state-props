1. **State:**

   - **Definition:** State is like memory for a React component. It represents the current situation or condition of that component.
   - **Usage:** Use state to store and manage dynamic data that can change during the component's lifecycle.
   - **Example:** If you're building a counter component, the current count value would be stored in the state.

2. **Props:**
   - **Definition:** Props (short for properties) are how components receive information from their parent component or the outside world.
   - **Usage:** Pass data from one component to another by using props. They are like parameters passed to a function.
   - **Example:** If you have a "Person" component, you might pass the person's name, age, and other details as props.

In simple terms, think of state as an internal memory for a component, holding information that can change, while props are a way for components to communicate, passing information from one to another.
