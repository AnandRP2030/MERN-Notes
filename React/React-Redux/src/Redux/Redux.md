1. Redux is a state management library commonly used with React to manage the state of an application in a predictable way.
2. Redux provides a centralized state management solution.
3. Redux stores the entire state of your application in a single JavaScript object called the "store".
4. State: The data that describes the current condition or status of your entire application.
5. Redux Store: A centralized location that holds the complete state of your application.
6. Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that describe changes to be made to the state.
7. Reducers: Functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.

It helps to centralize the state of your application, making it easier to manage and update the state across components. One of the main problems it addresses is the "prop drilling" issue, where you need to pass data through multiple layers of components via props.

In a Redux setup, you have a single global state (store) that is accessible by any component in your application. Components can dispatch actions to modify the state, and they can also subscribe to changes in the state. This eliminates the need to pass data through props manually and allows for a more organized and scalable state management.
