### What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text. JavaScript can manipulate this tree structure, allowing developers to dynamically alter the content and appearance of a webpage.
