1. Promise is a method of handling asynchronous operations
2. Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
3. A Promise can be in one of three states:

   Pending: The initial state. The promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected. It's in progress.

   Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.

   Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.
