1. **JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language:**

   - **Lightweight:** JavaScript is considered lightweight because it is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use language and dynamic typing, which makes it well-suited for web development.
   - **Interpreted:** Unlike compiled languages, JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed line by line by the browser's JavaScript engine rather than being precompiled into machine code.

2. **Designed for creating network-centric applications:**

   - JavaScript is particularly well-suited for developing applications that operate in a networked environment, such as the internet. It enables the creation of interactive and dynamic content on web pages.

3. **Complimentary to and integrated with Java:**

   - Although the statement suggests integration with Java, it's important to note that JavaScript and Java are distinct and separate languages. The use of the term "complimentary" implies that JavaScript can work alongside Java in web development. However, the actual integration is typically achieved through the use of technologies like Java applets (now less common) or more modern approaches like integrating JavaScript with server-side Java technologies.

4. **Very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML:**

   - JavaScript is often embedded directly into HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the standard markup language for creating web pages. This integration makes it easy to add JavaScript code to web pages and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing for dynamic changes to the content and behavior of a webpage.

5. **Open and cross-platform:**
   - JavaScript is an open-source language, meaning that its specifications are publicly available, and developers can contribute to its improvement. Additionally, being cross-platform implies that JavaScript code can run on various operating systems and devices without modification, contributing to its versatility and widespread adoption.

6. Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, allowing variables to hold values of any type. This flexibility can simplify code and reduce the need for explicit type declarations.
var x = 5,
x = "abcd",
(java is a static typed language. string x = "abcd")
