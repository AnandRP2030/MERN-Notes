We mostly write a computer program in high-level languages (javascript, java, python etc), which humans understand. High-level languages are that which contains words and phrases from human languages - for example, English. The high-level programming language is also known as source code in a computer program.

Computers only understand machine code that is 1 and 0.

To perform an instruction written in high-level language via computer, we need to convert it into machine language. To do this, either a compiler or an interpreter, or both are used to convert a source code programming language into machine code

Compiler and interpreter are software programs that convert a high-level language into a machine language (0's and 1's binary form) that a computer can understand and perform tasks as per the program's instructions.But there are variations in the working process and steps of a compiler and interpreter.

## Compiler

A compiler is a software program that follows the syntax rule of programming language to convert a source code to machine code. It cannot fix any error if present in a program; it generates an error message, and you have to correct it yourself in the program's syntax. If your written program is correct (contains no error), then the compiler will convert your entire source code into machine code. A compiler converts complete source code into machine code at once. And finally, your program get executes.

## Interpreter
An interpreter is also a software program that translates a source code into a machine language. However, an interpreter converts high-level programming language into machine language line-by-line while interpreting and running the program.
