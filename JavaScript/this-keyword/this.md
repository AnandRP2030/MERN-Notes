In JavaScript, the **`this`** keyword refers to the current execution context or the object that the function is a method of. The value of **`this`**can vary depending on how a function is called and what context it is called in.

In JavaScript, the 'this' keyword refers to the current object or context in which a function is being executed. It is a way for a function to access and operate on the properties and methods of the object it belongs to.

`const person = {
    name: 'John',
    sayHi() {
        console.log(Hi, my name is ${this.name});
    }
};`

`person.sayHi(); // Outputs: Hi, my name is John`

In this example, **`this`** refers to the **`person`**object. When we call the **`sayHi`** method on the **`person`**object, **`this`** refers to the object itself, so the output is "Hi, my name is John".
