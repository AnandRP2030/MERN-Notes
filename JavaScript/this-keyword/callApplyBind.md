In JavaScript, the `call` and `apply` methods are used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and arguments. These methods are used to explicitly set the context (the value of `this`) for a function when it is called.

In your example, you have a function `printName` and two objects `user1` and `user2`. Let's break down how `call` and `apply` are used in this context:

### `call` method:

```javascript
console.log("call method below");

// Using call to invoke printName with user1 as the context (this)
printName.call(user1); // Output: Name User one

// Using call to invoke printName with user2 as the context (this)
printName.call(user2); // Output: Name user two
```

In the above code, `call` is used to invoke the `printName` function with the specified `this` value (`user1` or `user2`). When `printName.call(user1)` is called, the `this` inside `printName` refers to `user1`, and when `printName.call(user2)` is called, the `this` inside `printName` refers to `user2`.

### `apply` method:

```javascript
console.log("apply method below");

// Using apply to invoke printName with user1 as the context (this)
printName.apply(user1); // Output: Name User one

// apply method can also take an array of arguments
let args = []; // No additional arguments in this case
printName.apply(user2, args); // Output: Name user two
```

The `apply` method is similar to `call`, but it takes an array of arguments instead of a list of arguments. In your example, the function `printName` doesn't take any additional arguments, so an empty array `args` is used.

In summary, both `call` and `apply` allow you to explicitly set the `this` value when calling a function. The primary difference is in how additional arguments are passed: `call` takes a list of arguments, while `apply` takes an array of arguments.
