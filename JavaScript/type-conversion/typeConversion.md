Implicit and explicit type conversion (also known as type coercion) refer to the ways in which programming languages handle the conversion of data from one data type to another.

1. **Implicit Type Conversion:**

   - In implicit type conversion, the language automatically converts one type of data to another without requiring the programmer to explicitly request the conversion.
   - This often occurs in situations where the operation or expression involves different data types, and the language automatically handles the conversion.
   - The goal is to ensure that the operation can be performed without causing errors.
   - Example in JavaScript:
     ```javascript
     var num = 5;
     var str = "2";
     var result = num + str; // JavaScript implicitly converts num to a string and performs string concatenation
     console.log(result); // "52"
     ```

2. **Explicit Type Conversion:**
   - Explicit type conversion, also known as casting, occurs when the programmer explicitly converts data from one type to another.
   - This is done using predefined functions or operators provided by the language.
   - The programmer explicitly indicates the desired conversion, making it clear in the code.
   - Example in JavaScript:
     ```javascript
     var str = "123";
     var num = Number(str); // Explicitly converting the string to a number using the Number() function
     console.log(num); // 123 // NaN
     ```

In summary, implicit type conversion is automatic and performed by the language, while explicit type conversion requires the programmer to specify the conversion using appropriate functions or operators. It's important to be aware of these mechanisms, as they can affect the behavior of your code and help avoid unexpected errors or results.
