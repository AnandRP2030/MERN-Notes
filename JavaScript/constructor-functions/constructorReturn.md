In JavaScript constructor functions, the `return` statement plays a specific role when used within the constructor. The rules are as follows:

1. **If `return` is called with an object:**

   - The object returned by `return` takes precedence over the default behavior of returning the newly created instance (`this`).
   - The instance properties defined inside the constructor may be overridden by the properties of the returned object.

   ```javascript
   function BigUser() {
     this.name = "John";
     return { name: "Godzilla" }; // Returns this object, overrides this.name
   }

   alert(new BigUser().name); // Outputs: Godzilla
   ```

2. **If `return` is called with a primitive value or without any value:**

   - The primitive value or the absence of a value returned by `return` is ignored.
   - The newly created instance (`this`) is returned by default.

   ```javascript
   function SmallUser() {
     this.name = "John";
     return; // Returns this (ignores the return statement)
   }

   alert(new SmallUser().name); // Outputs: John
   ```

The purpose of allowing a `return` statement in a constructor is to provide flexibility, but it's important to use it judiciously. Generally, constructors are used to set up the initial state of an object, and returning a different object could lead to unexpected behavior.

In the examples you provided, `BigUser` returns a different object, and `SmallUser` has a `return` statement without any value, which effectively returns the default instance (`this`).
