## Breakpoints
Breakpoints in responsive design are specific points or ranges in the CSS where you define styles based on the width of the viewport. The choice of breakpoints depends on your design and the specific needs of your content. Here's a common set of breakpoints used in responsive web design:

1. **Small Screens (Mobile):**
   - Breakpoint: 0 to 600 pixels (max-width: 600px)
   - Target devices: Mobile phones

2. **Medium Screens (Tablets):**
   - Breakpoint: 601 to 900 pixels (min-width: 601px and max-width: 900px)
   - Target devices: Tablets

3. **Large Screens (Desktops and Laptops):**
   - Breakpoint: 901 pixels and above (min-width: 901px)
   - Target devices: Desktops and laptops

These are general guidelines, and you can adjust them based on your specific design and the content you're working with. The breakpoints help ensure that your website looks good and is usable across a variety of devices with different screen sizes.
