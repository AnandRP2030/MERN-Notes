1. **Library:**
   - A library is a collection of pre-written code, functions, and routines that can be reused for various tasks without modifying their source code.
   - Libraries typically focus on providing specific functionalities, such as data manipulation, parsing, or networking.
   - Developers have more control over the flow of their code when using a library. They choose when and how to use the library's components.

2. **Framework:**
   - A framework is a more comprehensive and structured set of pre-written code that dictates the architecture and flow of an application.
   - It provides a skeleton where developers build their applications by filling in the specific functionality. In other words, the flow of control is more dictated by the framework.
   - Frameworks often include libraries, but they also enforce a specific structure and design patterns for the application.

**Bootstrap:**
- Bootstrap is considered a framework. It is a front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications.
- While Bootstrap includes a set of pre-designed UI components (like buttons, forms, navigation bars), it goes beyond a simple collection of UI elements. Bootstrap also provides a grid system, responsive utilities, and a variety of JavaScript plugins for common interactions.
- Bootstrap dictates a certain structure and style for your web pages, making it more than just a collection of UI components (which would be more characteristic of a library).
