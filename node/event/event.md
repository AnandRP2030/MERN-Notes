Event-driven programming, particularly in Node.js, is widely used in various real-life projects, especially those involving server-side applications, web development, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Here are a few examples:

Web Servers: In web development, Node.js is often used to create web servers. Event-driven programming allows these servers to efficiently handle multiple incoming requests simultaneously. Each HTTP request from a client is treated as an event, and the server responds accordingly.

Real-time Applications: Applications that require real-time communication, such as chat applications, online gaming platforms, or collaborative editing tools, can benefit from event-driven programming. Events like new messages or user actions trigger updates in real-time for all connected clients.
