JWT, or JSON Web Tokens, serve as a means of securely transmitting information between parties in a compact and self-contained manner. They are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications and APIs. The primary purposes of JWT include:

1. **Authentication**: JWTs are commonly used as a mechanism for user authentication. When a user logs in, the server can issue a JWT token containing information about the user's identity and permissions. This token can then be sent with subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

2. **Authorization**: JWTs can also carry information about the user's permissions and roles, allowing servers to make authorization decisions based on the information contained within the token.

3. **Stateless Communication**: Unlike traditional session-based authentication methods, JWTs are stateless, meaning servers do not need to store session state. This makes them particularly useful in distributed and microservices-based architectures.

4. **Information Exchange**: JWTs can be used to securely transmit information between different parts of an application or between different applications. The information contained within the JWT is digitally signed, ensuring its integrity and authenticity.

5. **Compactness and Efficiency**: JWTs are compact in size, making them efficient for transmission over networks. They can be easily encoded and decoded using standard algorithms.

Overall, JWTs provide a flexible and secure way to handle authentication and information exchange in modern web applications and APIs.
